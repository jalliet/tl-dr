## Quick Start

1. Install poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/

2. Go to /videoxity (here) and run:

```
poetry install
poetry shell
```

3. Run the vercel frontend:
Go to /vercel-frontend and run:
CTRL + SHIFT + F and search for "api: `http://localhost:8000/api/chat`", this is for local host
```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

4. Run the fastapi app:
Go to /videoxity (here) and run:
```
poetry run python main.py
```

## Deploy

Probably deploy the fastapi app on a managed docker service and then point the vercel app to the fastapi app endpoint, and deploy on vercel.


This is a [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) project using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) bootstrapped with [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama).

## Getting Started

First, setup the environment with poetry:

> **_Note:_** This step is not needed if you are using the dev-container.

```
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Then check the parameters that have been pre-configured in the `.env` file in this directory. (E.g. you might need to configure an `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you're using OpenAI as model provider).

If you are using any tools or data sources, you can update their config files in the `config` folder.

Second, generate the embeddings of the documents in the `./data` directory:

```
poetry run generate
```

Third, run the app:

```
poetry run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to start the app.

The example provides two different API endpoints:

1. `/api/chat` - a streaming chat endpoint
2. `/api/chat/request` - a non-streaming chat endpoint

You can test the streaming endpoint with the following curl request:

```
curl --location 'localhost:8000/api/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }] }'
```

And for the non-streaming endpoint run:

```
curl --location 'localhost:8000/api/chat/request' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }] }'
```

You can start editing the API endpoints by modifying `app/api/routers/chat.py`. The endpoints auto-update as you save the file. You can delete the endpoint you're not using.

To start the app optimized for **production**, run:

```
poetry run prod
```

## Deployments

For production deployments, check the [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) file.
